            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>GBasm is a Game Boy CPU emulator written in Java, designed to emulate the behavior of the Z80-like CPU used in the original Game Boy. The emulator simulates the CPU’s functionality by interpreting and executing opcodes one step at a time. It provides a modular design to facilitate easy expansion and testing.</p>

            <h2>Features</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>CPU Initialization and State:</strong> Initializes the Game Boy CPU registers and resets them to match the Game Boy's startup values.</li>
                <li><strong>Memory Handling:</strong> Handles memory reading and writing with bounds checking. Supports reading from and writing to memory locations.</li>
                <li><strong>Opcode Handling:</strong> Supports a few opcodes such as <code>LD A, d8</code>, <code>NOP</code>, <code>HALT</code>, and arithmetic instructions like <code>ADD A, B</code>, <code>SUB A, B</code>.</li>
                <li><strong>Fetch-Execute Cycle:</strong> Implements the fetch-execute cycle to simulate the CPU's behavior.</li>
                <li><strong>Memory Boundaries Checking:</strong> Ensures that reads and writes to memory addresses are within valid bounds (0x0000 to 0xFFFF).</li>
                <li><strong>Basic Debugging:</strong> Prints debugging messages for instruction execution, allowing you to monitor the CPU’s state.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h2>Current Limitations</h2>
            <p>While the emulator can run a small set of instructions, many opcodes are still unimplemented. Additionally, flag management and interrupt handling need to be implemented for full functionality. Future work will also include more advanced memory and I/O management.</p>

            <h2>Planned Features</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Full opcode set support</li>
                <li>Flag management for various instructions</li>
                <li>Interrupt handling</li>
                <li>Input/output handling for user interaction</li>
                <li>Enhanced debugging tools</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Getting Started</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Clone the repository: <code>git clone https://github.com/KaidaQ/GBasm.git</code></li>
                <li>Compile the project: <code>javac -d bin src/*.java</code></li>
                <li>Run the emulator: <code>java main.Emulator</code></li>
            </ol>
            <p>Once the emulator is running, you can modify the <code>Memory</code> class or add new opcodes to simulate additional functionality.</p>
